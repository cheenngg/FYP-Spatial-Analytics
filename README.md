# FYP-Spatial-Analytics

This repository consists of code for the FYP Project on Non-likelihood estimation methods for spatial predictions.
The 3 non-liklihood based methods explored are K-NN, Inverse Distance Weighting and HER. While, Oridnary kriging, a typical likelihood based method is explored as well. 
2 real life datasets, Meuse and Crimes will be used. Synthetic data adapted from the HER paper will be used as well.
